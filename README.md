Kanye is your friend with WiFi. You can ask him to do anything you would normally do if you had the Internet and he texts you back exactly what you want to know.

Kanye is the freshest virtual assistant. He's like Siri that uses text to communicate instead of voice, and doesn't require WiFi or a data plan.

Kanye is loved by fans all over because he allows you to...
