Kanye
=====

Team members: Aaron Morais, Amir Sharif, Andy Zhang, Kevin Bedi

Kanye is your friend with WiFi. You can ask him to do anything you would normally do if you had the Internet and he texts you back exactly what you want to know.

Kanye is like Siri that uses text to communicate instead of voice, and doesn't require WiFi or a data plan.

Kanye is loved by fans all over because he allows you to...

- Check your email or compose a new message
- View the latest posts on Hacker News
- View images and posts on Reddit
- Answer almost any question. Just add a question mark at the end.
  + Example: `How many students attend university of waterloo?`
  + Example: `What is the population of China?`
  + Example: `Who is the prime minister of Canada?`
  + Example: `How old is Jennifer Lopez?`
- Kanye can also give you advice. Just text `advice` to him.

All without data! Wow! Thanks Kanye!
